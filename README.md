## 1. Overview  

This project aims to predict **customer churn** for a retail banking dataset using multiple supervised learning algorithms.  
The focus is on building a **reproducible machine learning pipeline** that combines feature engineering, cross-validation, and explainability methods to generate both predictive and actionable business insights.  

Our models are benchmarked on multiple metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and Lift@10%) and interpreted through SHAP feature explainability and fairness evaluation across gender and geography.

## 2. Project Objectives  

1. Develop a unified pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.  
2. Compare three models from different algorithmic families:  
   - Logistic Regression (baseline linear model)  
   - Random Forest (bagging ensemble)  
   - XGBoost (boosting ensemble)  
3. Apply **SMOTE** to address class imbalance (Exited = 1 minority).  
4. Evaluate and compare model performance using **5-fold cross-validation** and an external holdout test.  
5. Interpret the model using **Feature Importance** and **SHAP**.  
6. Conduct **fairness checks** (Gender and Geography) to ensure responsible banking applications.  
7. Translate analytical findings into **business actions** â€” customer retention targeting and expected revenue estimation.
